# Security-Algorithms
This was my Security Project, I have implemented many security algorithms with thier encryption, decryption and some with Analysis too.
##
ALL algorithms are found in security library folder.
##
Algorithms Applied: 
- 1. DES
- 2. Triple DES
- 3. Diffie Helman
- 4. ElGamal
- 5. Main Algorithms  --> you will find these algorithms code in Main Algorithms
  - 5.1. Autokey Vigenere
  - 5.2. Ceaser
  - 5.3. Columnar
  - 5.4. Hill Cipher
  - 5.5. Mono Alphapetic
  - 5.6. Play Fair
  - 5.7. Rail Fence
  - 5.8. Repeating Key Vigenere
